## **üîê Cryptography Algorithms**

Cryptography algorithms can be classified into three main categories:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Symmetric Key Algorithms (Secret Key)**

* Uses **one secret key** for both encryption and decryption.
* **Faster** than asymmetric encryption but requires secure key sharing.

**Examples:**

* **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** ‚Äì Strong encryption used worldwide.
* **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** ‚Äì Outdated due to weak key length.
* **3DES (Triple DES)** ‚Äì Improved version of DES, but still slower than AES.
* **Blowfish** ‚Äì Secure and fast, supports variable key lengths.
* **ChaCha20** ‚Äì Used in modern applications for high-performance encryption.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Asymmetric Key Algorithms (Public Key)**

* Uses **a public key** for encryption and **a private key** for decryption.
* **Slower** but more secure than symmetric encryption.

**Examples:**

* **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)** ‚Äì Used in SSL/TLS, digital signatures.
* **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** ‚Äì Provides strong security with smaller keys.
* **Diffie-Hellman** ‚Äì Secure key exchange over an insecure network.
* **ElGamal** ‚Äì Used in cryptographic protocols.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Hashing Algorithms (One-Way Encryption)**

* Converts data into a fixed-size hash value (irreversible).
* Used for  **password hashing, digital signatures, and data integrity** .

**Examples:**

* **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm-256)** ‚Äì Used in Bitcoin and cybersecurity.
* **MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)** ‚Äì Insecure but still used for checksums.
* **SHA-3** ‚Äì Improved version of SHA for enhanced security.
* **Bcrypt** ‚Äì Used for password hashing with automatic salting.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Cryptography Tools**

Various tools help implement cryptographic techniques for security.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Encryption Tools**

* **OpenSSL** ‚Äì Used for SSL/TLS encryption, certificates.
* **VeraCrypt** ‚Äì Encrypts files, partitions, and drives.
* **AxCrypt** ‚Äì Easy-to-use file encryption tool.
* **GnuPG (GPG)** ‚Äì Implements PGP encryption for emails and files.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Management Tools**

* **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** ‚Äì Cloud-based key management.
* **HashiCorp Vault** ‚Äì Securely stores and manages secrets.
* **Microsoft Azure Key Vault** ‚Äì Encrypts and manages cryptographic keys.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Communication Tools**

* **Signal** ‚Äì End-to-end encrypted messaging app.
* **Tor Browser** ‚Äì Enables anonymous communication.
* **WireGuard** ‚Äì Secure VPN for private networking.

## **üìß Email Encryption**

Email encryption ensures that messages can only be read by the intended recipient.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Email Encryption Methods**

* **PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)** ‚Äì Uses RSA for encryption and digital signatures.
* **S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)** ‚Äì Uses digital certificates for email security.
* **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** ‚Äì Encrypts emails during transmission.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Email Encryption Tools**

* **ProtonMail** ‚Äì Provides built-in end-to-end encryption.
* **Tutanota** ‚Äì Secure, open-source encrypted email service.
* **Mailvelope** ‚Äì Browser extension for encrypting Gmail, Outlook emails.

## **üïµÔ∏è Cryptanalysis Tools**

Cryptanalysis tools are used to  **analyze and break cryptographic systems** .

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Password Cracking Tools**

* **John the Ripper** ‚Äì Cracks hashed passwords using brute-force.
* **Hashcat** ‚Äì Fast GPU-based password recovery.
* **Ophcrack** ‚Äì Cracks Windows passwords using rainbow tables.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Network Traffic Analysis Tools**

* **Wireshark** ‚Äì Analyzes encrypted network traffic.
* **Ettercap** ‚Äì Used for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Forensic Cryptanalysis Tools**

* **Cryptool** ‚Äì Simulates cryptanalysis attacks.
* **Cain & Abel** ‚Äì Recovers passwords and network credentials
