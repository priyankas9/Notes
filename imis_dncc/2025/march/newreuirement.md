**Fix this on the Schedule Desludging page:**

* When clicking on the *Confirm Emptying* action, hide the main form initially and display three buttons first.
* When a user selects the *Confirm* button, display the form but first show a message: *"You have selected the proposed emptying date set by the system."*
* If the user clicks on  *Reschedule* , display the form but allow the *Proposed Emptying Date* to be changed.
* If the user selects the *Disagree* button, do not display the form.
* Add a new label,  *Supervisory Assessment Date* , before the  *Proposed Emptying Date* .
