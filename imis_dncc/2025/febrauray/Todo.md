### 3. Site Settings Module

To ensure proper system configuration, follow these steps:

#### a. Create Database

* Design and create the necessary database schema.
* Define tables, columns, and relationships as required.

#### b. Create Model, Controller, and Service

* Develop a model to manage site settings.
* Implement a controller to handle requests related to site settings.
* Create a service layer for business logic and data handling.

#### c. Create View File

* Develop a view file to allow users to interact with site settings.
* Ensure proper UI/UX for ease of access and management.

### 4. Schedule Desludging Module

To implement schedule desludging functionality, follow these steps:

#### a. Create Database

* Design and define the necessary database schema for scheduling desludging operations.
* Define relationships between desludging schedules and related entities.

#### b. Create Model, Controller, and Service

* Develop a model to manage desludging schedules.
* Implement a controller to handle scheduling logic.
* Create a service layer for scheduling business logic and automation.

#### c. Create View File

* Develop a view file to allow users to manage and view desludging schedules.
* Ensure user-friendly interface for scheduling management.
